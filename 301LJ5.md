# Learning Journal Days 4&5 - November 30 & December 1, 2017

## November 30
Today we saw a demo of regex.  Two good sites are regex101.com to test and regexr.com for a cheatsheet.

Also, reviewed Handlebars templating. Step are:
1. Get template from HTML document
2. Compile with Handlebars
3. Return the HTML

  Also reviewed arrow functions (fat arrow =>).  
  If there's only one parameter, looks like input => 'code block'.  
  There's an impliicit return with one line of code.

  Lastly, ternary operator like an "if" "else" statement in shorthand.  'something' ? 'if true do this' : 'else do this'.
